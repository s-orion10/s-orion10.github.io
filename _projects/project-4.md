In this project we tackle **CarRacing-v0**, OpenAI Gym’s 2-D racetrack, treating each rendered frame as an image-classification task. By converting raw pixels into steering and throttle commands, we train an agent that masters the course—demonstrating how modern computer-vision pipelines and reinforcement learning can turn a blank-slate neural network into a self-driving racer.
